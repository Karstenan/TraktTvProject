# TraktTvProject
- Project developed during INFO216 Advanced Modelling at the University of Bergen. 
- Pulls user data from Trakt.tv and semantically tags the data. Queries can then be made concurently from the semantic trakt.tv database and LinkedMDB database, a semantic moviedatabase. 
- Checks the number of movies two users have in commmon where Kevin Bacon has acted

Will not currently work anymore, as Trakt.tv has updated it's API since the creation of this project.
